The problem statement says “Can you figure out who the trend setters are and who found the best waffle joint before waffles were cool? 
How much influence does my social circle have on my business choices and my ratings? 
Social graph mining is a kind of social network analysis where the main purpose of analyzing the data is towards
finding out which user is influencing your decisions regarding choosing a business service or how many users are influenced by you in choosing the same. 
To give an overview of what our project will be doing in terms of social graph mining, we can  say that we need to check the user and 
their friend list (get the friend data from yelp user object) and find all the places that a person’s social circle is interested in. 
Did they rate the business almost similarly or how much was the difference between their ratings? We need to do a particular set of 
calculations (form a similarity matrix) between the friends to find similarity between users. If a pair of users are similar, 
then we can say that the user’s choice has been influenced by a member of his social circle
